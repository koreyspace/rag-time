🎉 Welcome to **RAG Time**, a 5-week AI learning series where **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** meets innovation! This repository is your companion to the **video series, containing code samples, step-by-step guides,** and **resources** to help you master RAG concepts.

The RAG Time series aims to:

- Teach foundational and advanced RAG concepts.
- Demonstrate how RAG can be applied to real-world scenarios.
- Provide hands-on samples for practical implementation.


## Getting Started

To run the code samples included in this repository:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/microsoft/rag-time/fork) the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rag-time.git
cd rag-time
```

3. Navigate to the Journey of your choice and follow the README Instructions. 

## Learning Journeys

RAG Time runs every **Wednesday at 9AM PT** from **March 5th to April 2nd**. Each journey covers unique topics with leadership insights, tech talks, and code samples
