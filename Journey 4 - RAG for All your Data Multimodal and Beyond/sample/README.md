# Journey 4 - RAG for All Your Data: Multimodal and Beyond  
  
This section provides two sample projects designed to help you get started with fundamental code for integrating vectorization and query-time techniques, aiding you in your multimodal journey.  
  
1. **Integrated Vectorization Sample**: This sample includes code to set up your end-to-end search environment for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). It guides you through the process of chunking data, calling embedding models, and automatically applying these models at query time.  
  
2. **Basic Vector Workflow Sample**: This sample demonstrates how to configure multi-vector search and cross-field search. It also shows how to apply vector weighting to enhance retrieval relevance.  
  
Both samples are excellent starting points for leveraging multimodal capabilities and improving your search processes.
