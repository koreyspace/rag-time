## 🎥 Session Summary

### 🎥 The Power of Multimodal RAG

AI applications today must process more than just text—images, voice, and documents all play a role in delivering richer, more intuitive interactions. Multimodal workflows allow AI to match queries to multiple types of content, improving relevance and user experience. With advancements in GPT-4o real-time and Azure AI Foundry, developers can seamlessly integrate multimodal models into their applications, creating AI systems that understand and respond across various data types.

### 📚 Indexing and Retrieval for Multimodal Data

Indexing multimodal data ensures AI can retrieve the right information, regardless of format. Data ingestion and preparation help structure content for efficient search. Integrated vectorization converts different data types into a unified format, making it easier to search across text, images, and voice. Azure Document Intelligence and Content Understanding further enhance retrieval by extracting insights and analyzing semantics from unstructured data.

Advanced query techniques like multi-vector search, cross-field vector search, and vector weighting refine results, ensuring AI surfaces the most relevant information for each query. These strategies help developers optimize RAG workflows for accuracy, scalability, and speed.
